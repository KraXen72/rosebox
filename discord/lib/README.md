# rosebox > discord > lib
this uses the following projects to get up-to-date mappings for discord classes as scss selectors
  
- [DiscordSelectors](https://github.com/Zerthox/DiscordSelectors) - MIT licenced, see `LICENCE_DiscordSelectors.md`.
- [ClearVision](https://github.com/ClearVision/ClearVision-v6) - Apache 2.0 licenced, see `LICENCE_ClearVision.md`
- `rbMappings.scss` are missing mappings i added.
  
if there is a problem with the way i've included the licences or used the code from these projects, please contact me on discord `KraXen72#9190`
