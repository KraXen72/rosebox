mods that are crossed out either had EOL or are broken, they might work but not providing support for those

## Setting up the dev env
1. you need [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=glenn2223.live-sass) for vs code
2. if you want live reload, use something like betterdiscord. modify the paths in `scripts/watcher.js` to point at this directory and at the betterdiscord install directory. then run watcher.js while sass extension is watching

the old version of this theme in vanilla css can be found [here](https://github.com/KraXen72/rosebox-discord)
