# heya ~
this is my minimal rosebox-themed startpage made with some html, css and a bit of W3.CSS

are anime girls not your thing? or just want to get a more minimal look like this?

just uncomment the last 3 lines of the css
  
## installation (chrome / chromium)  
just clone this repo and load unpacked extension. (you have to enable developer mode)
