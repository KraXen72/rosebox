this is my minimal rosebox-themed startpage made with HTML, CSS, W3.CSS and JS.  
  
- click **bottom right &#9680;** to toggle the visibility of the image
- click **bottom left &#9881;** to open the settings popup 
- you can make these buttons **invisible but clickable** in the settings.

## intuitive settings / config ui + saving config to localStorage.

## installation (chrome / chromium)  
I included a simple ``manifest.json`` so you can import it as a chrome extension.  
just clone this repo and load unpacked extension. (you have to enable developer mode)

you can also install this in firefox or any browser, just set the ``index.html`` to your new tab page / create an addon which replaces the new tab page with this ``index.html``
